                        I started to read at the tender age of three, and by five I was perfectly literate. Since then, reading has been a huge part of my life; a habit that shaped my personality, my preferences and the way I look at the world. I remember my childhood from books I've read late at night or in the small library of the elementary school I attended, spending most of my time in quiet solitude. I discovered my love for tragedies pretty early, when I read Hamlet for the first time being nine years old. This love grew deeply when, in that small library, I encountered a collection of gothic tales that included authors like Teophile Gautier and John Polidori. 
                        Still during my childhood I had contact with the three authors that remain my favourites up to these days: J. R. R. Tolkien, V. C. Andrews and Lewis Carroll.
                        I absolutely adore stories with gotic motifs and indulge in then wholeheartedly, along with psychology, philosophy, history and art books. Bataille, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche and Thoreau are always on my bedside.
                    <br><br>
                        Flowers In The Attic, by Virginia C. Andrews, is by far the book I relate most to, being my favourite for almost my entire life. Cathy Doll is a character that I identified with when I was still a child. In the most difficult times of my life, this book made me feel less alone in my own attic. Every time I read FITA again I get this odd feeling of being embraced and understood in my emotions and personal experiences. While ackownledging that Cathy has moraly questionable relationships and controversial actions, as a lonely girl carrying a heavy burden in a young age, it was impossible to not bond with her because of our similar stories, emotional dilemmas, ways of loving people, need for hope, and, of course, our love for romance and ballet.

                        Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is another bok that accompanied me for years - Carroll is in my life since I was a little girl. Even before finding the Dollangangers, I already could relate to Alice, a curious soul, always trying to be gentle, and a bit lost too.
                    <br><br>
                        Therefore, I use Alice Dollanganger as a writer's pseudonym, uniting two of my biggest passions to represent my love for books and how they're part of me - evoking the feeling of belonging and comfort that I want to bring to my readers, one day. Currently, I'm working on a gothic romance.
